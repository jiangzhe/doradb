Define CI policy for blocking unsafe-usage count regressions in covered modules unless explicitly approved by allowlist/process.

## Reference

1. Source task document: `docs/tasks/000024-unsafe-usage-baseline-phase-1.md`.
2. Open question: CI guardrail for unsafe-count regressions.

## Scope Hint

- Decide baseline source and update workflow.
- Define acceptable exceptions and review process.
- Integrate with existing lint/test pipeline.

## Acceptance Hint

Unsafe regression gate policy is implemented or explicitly deferred with clear rationale and process.
