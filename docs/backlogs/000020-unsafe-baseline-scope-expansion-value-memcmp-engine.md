# Backlog: Unsafe Baseline Scope Expansion (`value`/`memcmp`/`engine`)

## Summary

Extend unsafe baseline inventory and review scope to additional modules (`value`, `memcmp`, `engine`) beyond original Phase-1 coverage.

## Reference

1. Source task document: `docs/tasks/000024-unsafe-usage-baseline-phase-1.md`.
2. Open question: whether and when to expand baseline module coverage.

## Scope Hint

- Update inventory tool module coverage.
- Regenerate and review baseline report deltas.
- Reassess risk hotspots and phase prioritization.

## Acceptance Hint

Baseline/reporting includes additional modules with documented impacts and next-step prioritization.
